# Additional Resources

Finished with Hello Web App? I list some of my favorite resources to continue
your education in the book, but for the sake of brevity, the list is rather
short. Here's a more complete list.

*More coming soon.*

## Python

### Books

***Two Scoops of Django* by Audrey Roy Greenfield and Daniel Greenfield**:
[http://amzn.to/13sLUh6](http://amzn.to/13sLUh6)
This book pretty much should be required reading after Hello Web App. Two Scoops is a resource book for Django best practices and expands on pretty much everything mentioned here. Definitely recommend adding this to your reading list.

***Test-Driven Development with Python* by Harry J. W. Percival**:
[http://amzn.to/1GrwlUF](http://amzn.to/1GrwlUF)
Interested in learning more about tests? The ones we did back in Chapter 13 are pretty much the very bare minimum — here, you’ll learn how to build tests first before writing your main code.

***Lightweight Django* by Julia Elman and Mark Lavin**:
[http://amzn.to/1M1kXl6](http://amzn.to/1M1kXl6)
More of an intermediate-to-advanced text with great information on how to integrate complex client-side interactions and real-time features into your web applications.
