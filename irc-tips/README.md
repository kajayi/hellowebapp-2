# Getting started with IRC

New to IRC? IRC is basically an online chat room containing many rooms for
people to chat about topics, including programming. 

This is a great resource to help you get started:

## What is IRC, anyway?

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an oldie-but-goodie chat protocol that is popular with developers in the open source community. There are many great channels where you can find help, offer up help to people asking simple questions you might know the answer to, or just lurk to absorb knowledge.

First, you'll need an IRC client. [There are many clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) suited for various kinds of users, most of them are free. If you feel up for it, you can try out a bunch of different and see what you like best. If you use an instant messaging tool like Pidgin or Adium, it's fairly easy to get started with IRC inside of it also. Otherwise, you can install a stand-alone IRC client like [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) for Windows or [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) for Mac.

There are many IRC servers, but most of the open source community lives in `chat.freenode.net`. Django users hang out in a channel called `#django`. Questions are more than welcome, no matter how silly or stupid you might fear they are.

For best results, don't ask to ask ("can I ask a question?") but rather politely dive into what you're trying to achieve and the problem you're facing. Example: "hi, I'm trying to setup template inheritence but it seems Django is not finding my base template, can somebody please point me to some resources/tips for debugging this?"

Even better, when you have a specific error stack trace you're having trouble figuring out, you can upload it to a pastebin service like [dpaste](http://dpaste.com/) and share the link within the IRC channel. Avoid pasting more than one line into the IRC channel, as it becomes very noisy and people get annoyed. Always use a pastebin service when you need to paste something. Be careful with sharing sensitive information like usernames and passwordsâ€”sometimes your stack trace will contain them. Triple-check that your paste content is safe to share before submitting it.

We hope to hear from you on #django @ freenode. Come by soon!
