## Python and Django installation instructions

We'll need to install Python, Django, and a few other utilities to your computer
before being able to build our web app!

### Installing Python

* [Mac OS X](https://github.com/limedaring/HelloWebApp/blob/master/installation-instructions/python-installation-mac.md)
* [Windows](https://github.com/limedaring/HelloWebApp/blob/master/installation-instructions/python-installation-windows.md)
* Linux (coming soon - [in the meanwhile, use this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/).)
* [Using a Virtual Machine (Juice Box)](https://jpadilla.github.io/juicebox/#get-started) - especially handy if you're using Windows.

### Installing Django

* [Install Django and start your project](https://github.com/limedaring/HelloWebApp/blob/master/installation-instructions/starting-your-project.md)
